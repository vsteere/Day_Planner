### Description

This project entailed creting an interactive day planner for a regular 9 to 5 business day. The application allows the users to enter text for every hour of the business day and then click save which saves it to local storage. This enables the data to still show in the application if the user reloads or re-opens the application.

The project also uses moment.js to show the current date and time at the top of the page. It also utilizes moment.js as part of Javascript logic that conditionally formats the time slots, depending if they are in the past, present, or future when compared to the curren time.
